## Description

This is a React application that utilizes hooks and React-router in order to generate a working cart system that processes payments through the Stripe API. This function is analogous to what you would see popular clothing brands use on their websites.

## Purpose

The purpose behind creating this project was to get myself comfortable with using React hooks such as useReducer, as well as learning how to use outside resources inside of a React application such as the axios library and the Stripe payment API. I also used this project as a way to sharpen my design skills as this is an original design that is fully responsive.

## Technologies

React Hooks: useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext

React Packages: React-router, react-currency-format

Google's Firebase(NoSQL database program): User authentication, Firestore Database to track order history

Stripe API: Used for payment processing

Node.js: Simple express server create to assist with Stripe payments

# How to Run Application

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
